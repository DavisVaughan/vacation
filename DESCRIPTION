Description: Provides additional holiday and calendar utilities
    extending the recurrence rules tools provided by the 'almanac'
    package. While 'almanac' provides the core tools for working with
    recurring events, it is a little challenging to use it to construct a
    full business calendar. The goal of 'vacation' is to provide an
    extensible system for adding custom holidays into a larger business
    calendar. 'vacation' comes with a number of common holidays built-in.
